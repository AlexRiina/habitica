        <p>A wintery breeze is blowing in from the Sto√Økalm Steppes, and the snow is gently drifting down over Habit City. The Winter Wonderland event has begun!</p>
        <h3>Winter Class Outfits</h3>
        <p>From now until January 31st, limited edition outfits are available in the Rewards column. Depending on your class, you can be a Blizzard Warrior, a Poinsettia Rogue, a Pyrotechnic Mage, or a Winter Star Healer! You'd better get productive to earn enough gold before they disappear. Good luck!</p>
